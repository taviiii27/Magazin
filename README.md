Here, I have used OOP and SQL to create this project, used for an electronics' store management, to select, insert, update and delete products. It is practical as it is easy to use and manage the store depending on products' attributes:
To detail more, I have made a file for each electronic found in the store more frequently: laptop, tablet, smartphone. For each of them, I have made different functionalities to see certain distinctions between products of each category(in smartphones, I have checked their colour.In tablets, I checked whether they are suitable for work or jsut entertainment, growing their prices gradually. In laptops, I have analysed different types of clients and what should he/she do if he/she will buy the laptop). I hope you will enjoy my project.
